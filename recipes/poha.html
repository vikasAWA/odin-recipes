        <p><strong>Poha</strong>, also known as pohe, aval, pauwa, sira, chira, chivda, or avalakki or baji, among many other names, is flattened rice originating from the Indian subcontinent. Rice is parboiled before flattening so that it can be consumed with very little to no cooking. These flakes of rice swell when added to liquid, whether hot or cold, as they absorb water, milk or any other liquids. The thickness of the flakes varies from almost translucently thin (the more expensive varieties) to nearly four times thinner than a normal rice grain.</p>
        <p>This easily digestible form of raw rice is very popular across India, Nepal and Bangladesh, and is normally used to prepare snacks or light and easy fast food in a variety of Indian cuisine styles, some even for long-term consumption of a week or more.</p>

            <h2>Why is my poha dry?</h2>
            <em>Give more standing time (soaking time). After you wash the poha, keep aside for minimum 15 minutes.
Still       if you find it dry, you can sprinkle water and give 10 mins more resting time.
You c       an also cook with a bowl of water kept inside and cook covered.</em>

            <h2>How poha stay soft for long time?</h2>
            <em>More moist poha stays soft for long time. So again give more resting time with little more water added while it is soaking.
                If you do not give enough resting time after washing poha, as it cooks and cools down later it becomes dry.
                Soaking time for poha is minimum 15 minutes.Poha is considered to be healthy or not depending upon what you are comparing.

                It is healthier than processed white rice, maida and other such refined or processed ingredients used for preparing food.</em>
